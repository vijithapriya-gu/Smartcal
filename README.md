# ABSTRACT
This machine learning project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the number of calories burned based on various physiological and activity-related factors such as age, weight, height, gender, heart rate, and exercise type. The model will be trained using machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods. Data preprocessing, feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning will enhance model performance. The system will help individuals, fitness enthusiasts, and professionals track calorie expenditure, optimize workouts, and manage weight effectively. By leveraging machine learning, this project provides a data-driven approach to improving health and fitness outcomes.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the number of calories a person burns based on physiological attributes and activity data. This will assist individuals, fitness enthusiasts, and professionals in monitoring calorie expenditure, aiding weight management, optimizing workouts, and enhancing fitness planning. The solution involves utilizing machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to analyze and predict calorie burn. The project will encompass data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and optimization, allowing users to input their data and obtain precise calorie burn estimates, thereby improving fitness tracking and personalized workout planning.
